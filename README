This package is a collection of country flags in PNG format.  The icons
are named by their ISO 3166-2 country code.

Original images where downloaded in gif format from the CIA World Factbook.
See:

The file appendix-d.txt is a massaged version of:

The script download.sh downloads missing images and converts them to PNG.
Note that some flags have been manually edited for various issues.

Note that currently the following entries fail:

Downloading:	AQ	Antarctica (AY; .aq)
ERROR: Download failed.  Investigate.
Downloading:	PS	Gaza Strip (GZ; .ps)
ERROR: Download failed.  Investigate.
Downloading:	PS	West Bank (WE; .ps)
ERROR: Download failed.  Investigate.

Antarctica is not a country, so that one is ok.
The CIA World Factbook doesn't have a flag for Palestine currently.
We should source one and import manually.
