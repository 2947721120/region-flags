== Introduction ==

This package is a collection of flags for BCP 47 region codes.  Most people
think of these as country flags, but there are a few codes / flags that do
not correspond to countries.  The icons are in PNG format and named by their
BCP 47 region code, which for countries is the same as ISO 3166-2 country
code.

The canonical way to get all region codes is to look for records in
language-subtag-registry (which is downloaded from [0]) with the following
fields:

	Type: region
	Subtag: [A-Z]{2}
	AND NOT Description: Private use
	AND NOT Deprecated: .*

The script regions.py lists all regions with their metadata.
The script missing.sh shows all such regions that we don't have flags for.


== CIA World Factbook ==

This repository was originally populated using flags from the CIA World
Factbook.  Original images where downloaded in gif format from [1].  The
file appendix-d.txt is a massaged version of [2] used for scripted
downloading.

The script cia-download.sh downloads missing images and converts them to
PNG.  Note that some flags have been manually edited to address various
issues.  See commit history for such modifications.

Using the download script the following entries fail:

Downloading:	AQ	Antarctica (AY; .aq)
ERROR: Download failed.  Investigate.
Downloading:	PS	Gaza Strip (GZ; .ps)
ERROR: Download failed.  Investigate.
Downloading:	PS	West Bank (WE; .ps)
ERROR: Download failed.  Investigate.

We fullfilled those (and others) manually.  See below.


== Exceptions ==

CIA World Factbook does not have an entry for some regions, or some
are not correctly mapped.  The following have been sourced separately:

- The European Union flag was downloaded from [1] manually.

- The following flags have been downloaded from Wikipedia.  We only
  do this when the file is in Public Domain (and NOT Creative Commons)
  in Wikipedia.

  * Flag of Palestine (PS) [3]
  * Flag of the Canary Islands (IC) [5]
  * Flag of Tristan da Cunha (TA) [6]

- The flag / map of Antarctica was downloaded from [4].

- The following regions use the same flag as a country and as such
  are symlinked:

  * Caribbean Netherlands (BQ) uses the same flag as Netherlands (NL),

  * United States Minor Outlying Islands (UM) uses the same flag as
    United States (US),

  * The Clipperton Island (CP) is an overseas possession of France (FR)
    and does not have a flag,

  * Ceutal and Melilla each have a flag, but the combined region
    'Ceuta, Melilla' (EA) does not have one; we use Spain (ES) flag,
