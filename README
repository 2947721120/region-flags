This package is a collection of country flags in PNG format.  The icons
are named by their ISO 3166-2 country code.

Original images where downloaded in gif format from the CIA World Factbook
at [1]  The file appendix-d.txt is a massaged version of [2] used for
scripted downloading.

The script download.sh downloads missing images and converts them to PNG.
Note that some flags have been manually edited to address various issues.
See commit history for such modifications.

Note that currently the following entries fail:

Downloading:	AQ	Antarctica (AY; .aq)
ERROR: Download failed.  Investigate.
Downloading:	PS	Gaza Strip (GZ; .ps)
ERROR: Download failed.  Investigate.
Downloading:	PS	West Bank (WE; .ps)
ERROR: Download failed.  Investigate.

Antarctica is not a country, so that one is ok.
The CIA World Factbook doesn't have a flag for Palestine currently.
We should source one and import manually.

Exceptions:

CIA World Factbook does not have an entry for some regions.  The following
have been sourced separately:

- The European Union flag was downloaded from [3].

- The flag of Palestine was downloaded from [4].
