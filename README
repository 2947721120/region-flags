This package is a collection of flags for BCP 47 region codes.  Most people
think of these as country flags, but there are a few codes / flags that do
not correspond to countries.  The icons are in PNG format and named by their
BCP 47 region code, which for countries is the same as ISO 3166-2 country
code.

Original images where downloaded in gif format from the CIA World Factbook
at [1]  The file appendix-d.txt is a massaged version of [2] used for
scripted downloading.

The script download.sh downloads missing images and converts them to PNG.
Note that some flags have been manually edited to address various issues.
See commit history for such modifications.

Using the download script the following entries fail:

Downloading:	AQ	Antarctica (AY; .aq)
ERROR: Download failed.  Investigate.
Downloading:	PS	Gaza Strip (GZ; .ps)
ERROR: Download failed.  Investigate.
Downloading:	PS	West Bank (WE; .ps)
ERROR: Download failed.  Investigate.

We fullfilled those (and others) manually.  See below.

Exceptions:

CIA World Factbook does not have an entry for some regions, or some
are not correctly mapped.  The following have been sourced separately:

- The European Union flag was downloaded from [1] manually.

- The flag of Palestine was downloaded from [3].

- The flag / map of Antarctica was downloaded from [4].

- The following regions use the same flag as a country and as such
  are symlinked:

  * Caribbean Netherlands (BQ) uses the same flag as Netherlands (NL),

  * United States Minor Outlying Islands (UM) uses the same flag as
    United States (US),
